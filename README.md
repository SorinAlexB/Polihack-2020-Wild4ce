# Polihack-2020-Wild4ce
This is the project created by the team Wild4ce during Polihack 2020 hackathon.

We created a site which was supposed to help people treat minor wounds at home during pandemic as the medical system was really busy because of the COVID-19 emergency. Also, on the site you can find tutorials about how to offer the first aid. On the last part of the project we talked about an application we tought about. The application would have all the information we offered on the site, also the possibillity to contact the firefighters, police, hospital and providing them the location where you are.
